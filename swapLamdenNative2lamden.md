### Overview

Transferring Lamden-native tokens (ex. TAU) from either Ethereum (ERC20) or Binance Smart Chain (BEP20) to Lamden is a five step process. Before starting, you will require:
* Lamden Wallet, installed and logged in
* MetaMask Wallet, installed and logged in
* A small amount of Lamden TAU to cover fees - approximately 5 TAU
* A sufficient amount of Ethereum or BNB to cover gas fees (especially during periods of high traffic)

### Initiating the Swap

The first steps are fairly explanatory. You'll be prompted with a series of steps to select which blockchain your tokens currently exist and which token you're intending to move.

1. Click *Start a New Swap*.
2. Click the blockchain where your tokens currently reside (Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain)
3. Select the token you want to move

> *Something went wrong...* - ensure you're on a desktop computer (LamdenLink is not compatible with mobile devices) and that pop-up blockers are disabled

### STEP 5

### Completed

Congrats! You've completed the swap and your tokens are now on the Lamden blockchain. You can view any of the completed transactions or return to the homepage.

### Adding the Token to display in the Lamden Wallet
Your token will now be in your Lamden Link account within your Lamden Wallet. If you don't see it (try clicking the refresh wheel next to your TAU amount first), then you'll need to make it visible. To do this, follow these steps:    

1. Within your Lamden Wallet, click *ACCOUNTS & TOKENS*    
2. From the Add New Account or Token popup:    
* Select *Token* from the "What to Add?" dropdown
* From the Add Existing tab, locate and select your token from the dropdown list
* Click *Add Token*

You are done! You will now see the token in your Lamden Wallet.

## What is Lamden Link?
Lamden Link is a two way link between the Lamden blockchain and Ethereum, which allows ERC20 tokens to move to the Lamden blockchain in wrapped form and return to Ethereum if desired.  Lamden link was created by the team at Lamden to allow value to move between both blochchains and future plans will include Lamden connecting with additional blockchains.

## How to Swap

You will need the following wallets which are both available on the Chrome store:
* Metamask - [available here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en)
* Lamden Wallet - [available here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lamden-wallet-browser-ext/fhfffofbcgbjjojdnpcfompojdjjhdim)

For ease of progress make sure you are signed in to both wallets before starting the swap.

### Overview

The picture below shows the basic process we are going to walk through to swap from Ethereum to Lamden.  Basically, we will start in Metamask, wrap the Ethereum on Etherscan, migrate it over to Lamden using the Lamden Link, and it will finish in your Lamden wallet.

### Wrapping your Ethereum (Etherscan)

>[!Note]
>Wrapping your Ethereum is all performed on the Ethereum side, be aware the speed and transaction costs differ significantly to using the Lamden network. Be prepared to wait for the Ethereum network to process the transaction and the possibility of high gas costs.    

1. Head over to Etherscan, specifically we need the WETH write contract. [Link here will get you to the right spot.](https://kovan.etherscan.io/token/0xd0a1e359811322d97991e03f863a0c30c2cf029c#writeContract)    

2. Connect Metamask to the Etherscan site by clicking the button highlighted below. Follow the prompts on Metamask to approve the site to interact with Metamask.

>[!Note] 
>The button you clicked should now be showing as green. If it is still red, click the button again, follow the prompts and it should now go green.    

3. Click the deposit dropdown to open the deposit section. Input the amount of Ethereum (ETH) you would like to wrap into WETH then click *Write*.    

>[!Note]
>If you get an error. Check to make sure you have enough Ethereum to swap, also make sure you are still connected - green light mentioned previously.    

4. You will get a popup from Metamask to confirm the transaction. Read the details, understand the gas fees associated, then click Confirm to continue.    

5. Wait for the Metamask confirmation.    

>[!Tip]
>You can check the progress of a pending transaction in Metamask by clicking *Activity*, then below that it *should* be the last transaction, click this. The popup offers a link in the top left to Etherscan to view to progress of the transaction. Completely optional, as Metamask keeps monitoring this for you - but if you are bored waiting can this can be good to check.    

6. The wrapping should have occured however we can't see the WETH until we add the token details to Metamask. In Metamask:    
* On the Main page, click *Assets*
* Then click *Add Token* (You may need to scroll down to see it)
* Add the following token address `0xd0a1e359811322d97991e03f863a0c30c2cf029c`
* The Token name should auotpopulate with WETH and the decimals will also autopopulate with 18
* click *Next* (you should see your WETH at this stage)
* click *Add Token*    

Thats it! You will now see the WETH in your Metamask ready to move to the Lamden network. Next step, using Lamden Link.    

### Lamden Link
1. Head over to Lamden Link - www.lamdenlink.com

2. When connecting to the LamdenLink site for the first time you will receive a prompt from the Lamden Wallet for "Lamden Account Creation". You will get two prompts similar to below, read the instructions, click *NEXT*, then *Create Account*.

>[!Note]
>Creating a separate account for the Link app is a normal security feature of Lamden to prevent access to your full wallet by any one application.

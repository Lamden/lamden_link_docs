## What is Lamden Link?
Lamden Link is a two-way link between the Lamden blockchain and other blockchains such as Ethereum (ERC20) or Binance Smart Chain (BEP20). The bridge is necessary to allow a variety of tokens to move seamlessly between different blockchains. 

Think of it as similar to a language translator between two different people. If I only speak English and you only speak Spanish, Lamden Link performs the role of the translator between us and enables us to seamlessly speak to each other.
